# Shortcut

## Intro
My senior capstone project for my Programming Languages Design & Implementation class, done in collaboration with Connor Dailey (College of the Holy Cross '25)

## The Program
- Shortcut is a map application written in Swift in which a user can search for locations using a natural language query.
- The user can specify broad or specific locations, such as coffee or Starbucks. The former will return places that sell coffee, the latter will return Starbucks.
- The user can also specify a number, n, of how many instances they want to show up. The amount entered will return the n closest locations. If no number is given, it uses a radius around the user.
- Upon searching, pins will drop indicating the locations returned by the query. Tapping a pin will result in the shortest possible path being drawn between the user and the pin.
- The user can specify modes of transportation (automobiles, bikes, walking) which will determine what kind of path can be drawn.
